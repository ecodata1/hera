WORK IN PROGRESS

Hera is a prototype package to explore the future of regulatory environmental
modelling. The package outlines possible approaches to creating a shared
research platform for building, testing and deploying models used to assess
environmental risk for regulatory purposes.
See [Request for
comment](https://ecodata1.github.io/hera/articles/hera_specifications.html)
paper for an outline and broad technical specifications.

Hera is envisaged as an opinionated collections of R packages designed for
sharing environmental models. All packages share an underlying design, grammar
and data structures. This allows the separation of the concerns between data,
models, post-modelling steps and visualisation. Allowing greater collaboration
and sharing of methods and tools.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/ecodata1/hera)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ecodata1/hera")
```

## Documentation

Read the [white paper article and documentation website](https://ecodata1.github.io/hera/articles/hera_specifications.html) (work in progress)

## Example

Assess some demo data for various environmental risks:

```{r example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(hera)
data <- assess(hera::demo_data)
data[1:5, c("sample_id", "parameter", "question", "response")]
```

Alternatively, you can view the `catalogue` and select which assessments to be
run.

```{r catalogue, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
catalogue
```

Then select which assessment(s) you wish to run by name:

```{r selected, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
assessments <- assess(demo_data,
  name = c(
    "RICT",
    "Macroinvertebrate Metrics"
  )
)
assessments[1:5, c("sample_id", "parameter", "question", "response")]
```
